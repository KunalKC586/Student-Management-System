## Error Handling

The application includes key error-handling mechanisms:

1. **Duplicate Student ID**: Ensures no two students share the same ID and provides an error message:

2. **Invalid Input**: Validates user inputs (e.g., numeric age) and prompts for corrections in case of errors.

3. **Non-Existent Students**: Displays a clear error message when attempting to update, view, or remove a non-existent student:

## Future Enhancements

Here are three main ideas for future development:

1. **Data Persistence**: Add functionality to save student records to a file or database for long-term storage.

2. **Search Functionality**: Enable users to search for students by name, course, or other attributes.

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Create a user-friendly interface for better interaction and usability.
